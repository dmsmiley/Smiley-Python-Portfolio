    "   - Write a query that returns each film’s title, description, and language name (labeled as “language”) from the `film` and `language` tables, for all films with length under 100. Join `film.language_id` to `language.language_id` to retrieve the language name.\n",

    "2. **Challenge 2: Specific Ratings Filter with Language**\n",
    "   - Write a query to display each film’s title, rating, and language name (as “language”) for all films whose rating is either ‘PG-13’ or ‘R.’ Join film.language_id to language.language_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Challenge 3: Pattern Matching on Film Titles with Category**\n",
    "   - Write a query to list each film’s title and its category name (as “category”) for all films whose title begins with “T” or ends with “s.” Join film to film_category and then to category to retrieve the category name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Challenge 4: Single-Character Wildcard with Actor Join**\n",
    "   - Write a query that lists each film’s title and the actor’s full name (using first_name || ' ' || last_name) for all films whose title has “y” as the second character. Join film, film_actor, and actor on their respective IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Challenge 5: Distinct Customer Payments and Rentals**\n",
    "   - Write a query to display each customer’s ID along with the total number of distinct payments and rentals they have made. Use LEFT JOIN with the payment and rental tables, group by the customer, and order by total payments (descending) then total rentals (descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Challenge 6: Advanced Filtering with Category**\n",
    "   - Write a query that returns each film’s title, rental rate, length, and category (labeled as “category”) for films whose rental rate is between 2.99 and 4.99, rating is either ‘PG’ or ‘R,’ and title starts with “A.” Join film to film_category and category to retrieve the category name.\n",
